# Dissertação - Augmented Reality for Enhanced Data and Information Visualization in Robotics Research
The work will be organized according to the following plan:
  1. Literature review of the state of the art on AR for robotics;
  2. Identification of possible usage scenarios and requirements;
  3. Familiarization with Virtual and Augmented Reality SDKs, 
  APIs and Devices - ROS, Unity, Vuforia, OpenCV, etc;
  4. Iterative design and development of prototypes;
  5. Continuous evaluation and testing of the developed prototypes
  to demonstrate their usefulness;
  6. Writing the Dissertation.
