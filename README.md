# Dissertação - Augmented Reality for Enhanced Data and Information Visualization in Robotics Research
The work will be organized according to the following plan:
  1. Literature review of the state of the art on AR for robotics;
  2. Identification of possible usage scenarios and requirements;
  3. Familiarization with Virtual and Augmented Reality SDK’s, 
  API’s and Devices - ROS, Unity, Vuforia, OpenCV, etc;
  4. Iterative design and development of prototypes;
  5. Continuous evaluation and testing of the developed prototypes
  to demonstrate their usefulness;
  6. Writing the Dissertation. 

## Work report:
   
#### Week 03/10 - 09/10
- Objective: First meeting with the advisors. See some tutorials about Augmented Reality
- Talk about what I'll be doing and some tips to help me through it all
   
#### Week 10/10 - 16/10
- Objective: Second meeting with advisors
- Talk about what papers I can read and where to find them
- Mention of some Dissertações from previous years that I should read

#### Semana 17/10 - 22/10
- Objective: Prepare a PowerPoint using the template provided to give an introduction to my Dissertation
- Final: Filled in what I knew but there is still some elements missing.

#### Semana 24/10 - 29/10
- Objective: 
	- Read a thesis from a previous year in a simular field
	- Do a simple unity project using augmented reality
- Final: 
	- Read about half of the thesis. Decided to abandon it as it was poorly written.
	- Finished the simple project but though to a bug, could not run it. (Asking for help with the teachers)
	
#### Semana 31/10 - 04/11
- Objective: 
	- Read a paper
	- Fix the bug
- Final: 
	- Read half-way through the paper
	- Fixed some other set-up problems within Unity but the original one persists

#### Semana 07/11 - 11/11
- Objective: 
	- Try to fix that set-up situation
	- Start doing a first implementation of a control guided robot in unity (without the use of the simulation)
	- Finish reading the paper
- Final:
	-
